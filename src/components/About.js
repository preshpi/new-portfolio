            I am a web developer with a strong background in frontend technology. 
            I am eager to gain job experience in order to improve my skills and advance my career. I am driven to advance in an industry that is a good fit for me, to solve frontend development difficulties, and to please web consumers.
            I knew what programming was all about after participating in the first She Code Africa training (SCA). I wasn't consistent until after High school which I later joined several internships programs like HNG, ZURI, KODECAMP and many more to help me improve my skills.
